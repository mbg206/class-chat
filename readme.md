# Class Chat

A very simple chat application. Originally developed in 1 day, but grew over time.

Depends only on `ws` and `sharp`.

Run `npm install` to download the dependencies, and then run `npm start` to start the server. The server will be hosted on port 8000 by default (http://localhost:8000), though it can be changed by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

## Features

- Multiple chatrooms

- Commands

  - **Built in commands:**

  - /online

  - /msg <user> <message>

- Image sending

- Client themes

## TODO

- Improve themes

- Create basic library to interact with the API?
